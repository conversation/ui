/**
 * The CardAction component is preferred when adding buttons to a CardActions
 * component.
 *
 * Rather than leave it up to each card to define the correct variants and
 * colours to use for the action buttons (e.g. save, cancel, etc.), this
 * component ensures consistency by abstracting the action buttons based on the
 * type of action that they perform.
 *
 * For example, dismissive buttons (e.g. cancel, no, etc.) should have lower
 * visual emphasis than primary buttons (e.g. save, yes, etc.), while secondary
 * buttons (e.g. delete, etc.) should be given a different emphasis to indicate
 * to the user that they perform a different action.
